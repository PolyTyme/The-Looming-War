<span style="font-family: solbera_imitationregular; font-size:100">O</span>gud, a blue [[dragonborn]] hailing from [[An Domhan]], emerged into the world amidst the harsh realities of poverty within [[Farendel]]'s slums. 
From his formative years, he confronted the challenges of survival head-on, devoid of familial support or societal privilege. 
His upbringing instilled in him a resilient spirit, shaped by the necessity of self-reliance and the trials of street life.

Predominantly found amidst the tumult of taverns and pub brawls, Ogud's presence was as consistent as it was notorious.
A towering figure, he thrived in the chaotic atmosphere, his actions speaking volumes about the type of individual he had become, a survivor, a fighter, and a force to be reckoned with in the unforgiving streets of [[Farendel]].


## Story

**O**gud's upbringing was anything but conventional. Orphaned at birth, he was raised by the very community that had witnessed his first cries.
With his mother's passing during childbirth, he became a ward of the streets, his survival dependent on the gritty embrace of [[Farendel]]'s slums.

From the earliest days of his youth, Ogud was a figure of contention, his fiery spirit often manifesting in the form of fisticuffs.
Whether spurred by necessity or simply to release the pent-up energy of his tumultuous existence, he was no stranger to conflict.
His days were spent prowling the alleys, a shadow amidst the city's bustle, deftly relieving unsuspecting passersby of their belongings.

Yet, fate took an unexpected turn when a chance encounter led him into a brawl with a wiry [[Elf]] in a seedy pub.
Little did Ogud know that this seemingly insignificant scuffle would alter the course of his destiny.<div class='note flavor sig' style='position: absolute; right: 220'><p> "That's not a melee weapon.", "It is now!" -DM&Ogud</p></div>

For in that moment of chaos, he discovered that his adversary was none other than`secret nyGC1jCk4Y6q/YtCmRbIwpo0iVhuDUSEsfyJQel5ptcLC0aMBwzJrU+bSmEQT3A05hsqNqHnuXs8FsABvJsMXMGUuFFtKQ7UImVICZl52wSgywbb/yZSOckmki0UknUwnSnHdwiBiyEXFhpDvZz1fC0n98ugAzFugPHH`
Bound by the unlikeliest of alliances, Ogud and`secret JpSbZT2V/5QQHIe4jStihWo9AgncRm1CRdPiBvAQP/VqFMf6Q4feNfcW2WKhp21HueAIlBgmTPx+9vs=`forged a friendship that transcended the boundaries of their respective stations in life.
