# Awaken
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*5th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 8 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the [awakened shrub](awakened-shrub.md) or the [awakened tree](awakened-tree.md).

The awakened beast or plant is [charmed](Conditions.md#charmed) by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the [charmed](Conditions.md#charmed) condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was [charmed](Conditions.md#charmed).

**Classes**: [Bard](Bard.md), [Druid](System%20Resources/DND%20Wiki/Classes/Druid/Druid.md)
