# Blight

*4th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes `8d8` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
