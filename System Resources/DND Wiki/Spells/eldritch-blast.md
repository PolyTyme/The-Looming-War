*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d10` force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

**Classes**: [Warlock](System%20Resources/DND%20Wiki/Classes/Warlock/Warlock.md)
