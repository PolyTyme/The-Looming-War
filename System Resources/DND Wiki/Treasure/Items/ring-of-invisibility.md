# Ring of Invisibility
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this ring, you can turn [invisible](Conditions.md#invisible) as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is [invisible](Conditions.md#invisible) with you. You remain [invisible](Conditions.md#invisible) until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
