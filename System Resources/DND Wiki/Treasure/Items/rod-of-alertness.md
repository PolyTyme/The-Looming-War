# Rod of Alertness
*Rod, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.

## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](skills.md#Perception)) checks and on rolls for initiative.

## Spells

While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [detect evil and good](detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](detect-magic.md), [detect poison and disease](detect-poison-and-disease.md), or [see invisibility](see-invisibility.md).

## Protective Aura

As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any [invisible](Conditions.md#invisible) hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
